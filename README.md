# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app created using HTML/SCSS/VanillaJS.

## Difficulties:

For me, the main difficulty of this project is the edge cases that crop up during the implementation phase. Examples of this are the following:

- Checking if there is already an inputted dot
- Checking if you're dividing by zero
- Checking if the previous input are numbers instead of 'Math Error'
- Iffiness of type coercion

and others...

## Where to go from here

- I could probably add keyboard support for better ux
- Implement a scientific calculator (More than likely not because of the complexity)
- Implement a 'cancel' instead of clear so the previous input won't be deleted
